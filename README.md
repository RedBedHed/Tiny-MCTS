# Tiny-MCTS
##### <i>A smol version of tic-tac-toe MCTS with little-to-no optimization.</i>

<p>
Monte Carlo Tree Search is a versatile search algorithm for making decisions. 
Its applications range from game-playing to vehicle-piloting.
</p>
</br>
<p>
MCTS is an iterative algorithm that repeatedly executes four subroutines.</br>

```
1. Selection
2. Expansion
3. Simulation
4. Back-propagation
